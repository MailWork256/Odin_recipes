        Making your own homemade pizza is a delightful experience. 
        To start, prepare the dough by mixing flour, yeast, salt, olive oil, warm milk, and water. 
        Let it rise until doubled in size. Shape the dough into balls and roll them out. 
        Spread pasta (or tomato sauce) on each pizza base, top with torn mozzarella cheese, and add your favorite toppings. 
        Bake until the bases are crisp and golden brown. 
        Finally, scatter fresh basil leaves over the cooked pizzas and enjoy your delicious creation! üçïüòä Remember, you can freeze the dough for future use. 
        Divide it into balls, wrap in cling film, and defrost before making more pizzas.
